# Networking with Mininet and Ryu: Traffic Prediction in SDN Networks

## Overview

This project aims to analyze traffic patterns and predict traffic in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments using Mininet and Ryu. The goal is to capture network traffic, train a machine learning model for traffic prediction, and analyze the model's performance.
